# Bug Report: Applications Table Not Rendering

**Date:** {{ Today's Date }}

**Component:** `pages/applications/index.vue` and `components/ApplicationsTable.vue`

**Issue:**
The applications table was reported as not rendering on the `/applications` page.

**Analysis:**
- The `pages/applications/index.vue` component correctly fetches mock data and passes it to the `components/ApplicationsTable.vue` component.
- The `components/ApplicationsTable.vue` component iterates through the data using `v-for` and renders the `components/StatusBadge.vue` for each application's status.
- Initially, the `components/StatusBadge.vue` component was missing specific CSS classes (e.g., `status-pending`, `status-approved`) required for styling status badges based on application status. Missing CSS classes typically affect styling but shouldn't prevent the entire table structure (rows, columns, text) from rendering. Further investigation would be needed (e.g., browser console check) if the table truly failed to render any content.

**Current Status / Fix Applied:**
- A `<style scoped>` block *was initially added* to `components/StatusBadge.vue` defining the previously missing status classes (`status-pending`, `status-approved`, `status-rejected`, `status-review`) using Tailwind utility classes.
- **Refactoring:** The component has been refactored. The `statusClass` computed property now directly returns the appropriate Tailwind classes (e.g., `bg-green-100 text-green-800` for 'approved') for *all* statuses, including 'incomplete'.
- The `<style scoped>` block has been removed, along with the intermediate `status-*` class definitions.
- This ensures consistent styling logic within the component's script and improves maintainability.

**File Modified:** `components/StatusBadge.vue` (Initially and then Refactored)

**Next Steps / Recommendations:**
- **Verify Rendering & Styling:** Confirm in a browser that the `/applications` page and the `ApplicationsTable` render correctly, and that all status badges are styled as expected (Pending: Yellow, Approved: Green, Rejected: Red, Review: Blue, Incomplete: Secondary/Gray). Check the browser console for any errors.
- **Build Test (Optional):** Run the production build process (e.g., `npm run build`) to ensure Tailwind correctly includes all necessary utility classes used in `StatusBadge.vue` and doesn't improperly purge them.
- **Global Styles (Consideration):** While the component is now self-contained, if these exact status styles (colors, text, shape) are needed frequently elsewhere, defining them globally (e.g., in `tailwind.config.js` via a plugin or in a global CSS file) could still be considered for maximum reusability, though the current approach is valid.
